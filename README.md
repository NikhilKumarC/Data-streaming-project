Building a Real-Time Stream Pipeline with AWS Kinesis and Databricks Delta Live Tables

The goal of this project was to develop a scalable and real-time data processing solution to handle high-velocity data streams efficiently. By combining the flexibility of AWS Kinesis with the advanced features of Databricks Delta Live Tables, I was able to achieve exceptional results.

Key features of my stream pipeline project:

ðŸŒŠ AWS Kinesis: I utilized Kinesis Streams, a fully managed service, to capture and store high volumes of streaming data. Its fault-tolerant and scalable architecture ensured the seamless ingestion and handling of real-time data.

ðŸ”— Databricks Delta Live Tables: Leveraging the power of Databricks Delta, I created live tables to store the streaming data in an optimized format. The built-in indexing and efficient data compaction capabilities of Delta Lake ensured quick access to the most up-to-date data for downstream analytics.
